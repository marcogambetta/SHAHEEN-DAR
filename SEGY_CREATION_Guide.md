# SEGY CREATION GUIDE

This document provides the needed detail to create a seismic SEGY merging DAR seismic recordings with navigation and shot data.

## Foreword
**SEGY** is an international standard for seismic data exchange and storage, designed to host multi-dimensional data with geographical and time reference.
Bare sensor recordings are nearly useless to the seismic industry because the description of elastic wave propagation requires accurate spatial and time localization.
